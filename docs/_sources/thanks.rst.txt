Thanks
######

- Thanks to the teams behind OpenCV and Pillow - this entirely frivolous project would not exist without you.

- Thanks to my family and friends for all the support they give me in everything I do.

- Special thanks to Jabari King, who got me into programming and has always helped me when I had a problem.

- Of course, thanks to David Bowie, for making such rad music.

- Thanks for you, for showing interest in an amateur programmer's projects! It means a lot.
