Tutorial
========

This is a tutorial for using the Bowienator in the command line.

To install this Python module, just enter the following

``pip install bowienator``

into your Terminal or Command Line.

Let's say that you have a picture of popular Swedish pop group ABBA:

.. image:: ABBA_Before.jpg
	:width: 480pt

And instead of Agnetha, BjÃ¶rn, Anni-Frid, and Benny; you want to see 
Aladdin Sane era David Bowie. You can enter a command line at the directory
holding the bowienator.py script, and enter

``> bowienator.py path/to/the/image/file/here.whatever``

The script will run, and automatically detect faces in the photo, put the David Bowie
picture over theirs, and save the picture in the same directory as the original.

If you ran that picture of ABBA through the program, you would get:

.. image:: ABBA_After.png
	:width: 480pt

And that's how it done.
