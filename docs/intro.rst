This is the documentation for my project, the Bowienator.

The Bowienator is primarily a Python script that uses face detection to slap a picture of David Bowie's face over faces in the picture.

However, the Bowienator also serves as a small Python module with two functions - one to search for faces in photos, and
one to draw the Bowie faces - or any other picture over top of the detected faces.
